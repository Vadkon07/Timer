# Terminal Timer

This timer is adapted to work inside Windows, Linux, and MacOS terminals. When you run this app, you can notice that she has some options to choose as normal timer, pomodoro timer, and also custom presets.

## Features

**1.** In the end of countdown app will play a sound. You can set any sound instead of this "microwave", just replace "end.wav" with your sound. I choosed this sound because he sounds calm.

**2.** Simplicity it was my key goal during developmento of this app.

**3.** Integrated pomodoro timer is looped, so you can work without thinking about it. Just be sure that you turned on volume on your computer.
